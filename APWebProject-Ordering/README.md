Project Title - Bake Me Away

Description This projectâ€™s main aim is to develop an easy to use web-store that assists in ordering different variety of Cakes online. The objective that this project tries to achieve is to make an easy to use, interactive, one stop shop for all your cake related requirements. To facilitate choices and make ordering easy, we follow a user interactive interface where a user has hundred percent control over the choices he wants to make about their product. This is achieved by providing the user with a wide range of options from which they can handcraft their own final product.

What makes your project stand out? The idea finds its origin in one of the developers own interest in baking which led to the development of this online store. This makes it very personalized and we have tried to give it a touch of our own.
